  <h2> Rookie Curry (2009-2010)</h2>

  <p> After a successful 3 years at Davidson College, Curry declared for the draft, which took place in Madison Square
    Garden.
    A lot of teams were skeptical about him, due to his frame and injury concerns, therefore they passed on him. But one
    teams
    saw his potential: The Golden State Warriors. They drafted him 7th overall, which began his NBA career.</p>

  <p> During his rookie season, Steph Curry showed the world glimpses of what he was made of, averaging 17 ppg, 5.9 apg and 4.5 rpg, finishing
    second in Rookie of the Year voting (ROTY), only behind Tyreek Evans. Curry was named to the All-Rookie First Team, but unfortunately,
    the Warriors failed to make the playoffs</p>

    

    <h2> 2010-2011 (Sophmore Season)</h2>
      
      <p> Entering his Sophmore Season, Curry continued to improve his skills, as he upped his scoring average to
        18 ppg, while leading the league in free throw shooting at 93.1%. Unfortuantely, Curry started having ankle problems, which kept him out 
        for a portion of the year. This wouldn't be the last time his ankle becomes an issue</p>

        

        <h2> 2011-2012 season</h2>
        <!-- the p tag is a paragraph tag, which is used for writing.-->
        <p> This year was one of Curry's worst years, playing only 26 out of the possible 66 games (Lockout Season). He repeatedly
          sprained his right ankle several times early in the season, which caused him to miss so many games.</p>
          <br>
          <p> The Warriors almost traded Curry to the Milwakke Bucks for Andrew Bogut, but the Bucks rejected the offer, being worried 
            about Curry's ankles. Instead, the Warriors traded Monte Ellis for Andrew Bogut, which saved their franchise.</p>

            <h2>2012-2013 season</h2>

            <p> Coming back from those ankle injuries, Steph Curry came back to the league with vengance in his mind, and he did just that.
              This year was his breakout season, as he averaged 23 ppg and led the NBA in 3s made with 272, setting an NBA record. This was also the year in which
              Curry and Klay Thompson got the nickname "Splash Brothers", due to their elite 3 point shooting. In the playoffs, the 
              Warriors shocked everyone, knocking out the Denver Nuggets in 6 games, but ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs in 6 games</p>

              <h2> 2013-2014 season</h2>

              <p> Stephen Curry continued his dominance by averaging 24 ppg and leading the Warriors to the Playoffs once again, making 261 three pointers.
                Unfortunately, the Warriors lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in 7 games. This year marked the beginning of Curry's prime.</p>

                <h2> 2014-2015 season</h2>

                <p> This season, Curry proved to everyone that he was the best player in the league, making an NBA record 282 three pointers and winning his 
                  first MVP as the Warriors finished with a 67-15 record and the 1 seed in the West. During the Playoffs, they steamrolled through the West and faced
                  LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and the Cleaveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. However, in Game 1, Kyrie Irving went down with an ankle injury, and he missed the rest of the Finals.
                  Without him, LeBron and the Cavs couldn't match up with the Warriors, and the Warriors won the Championship in 6 games.
