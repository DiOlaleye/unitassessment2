  <h2> 2015-2016 season</h2>

  <p>This season we saw a Stephen Curry we've never seen before, as he led the league in scoring with 30.1 points per
    game, as he made
    402 three pointers, shattering his previous record by over a hundred threes. The Warriors finished with a record of
    73-9,
    which still stands as the most wins in a season in NBA history, which also lead to Curry becoming the first and only
    unanimous MVP
    in history. The Warriors steamrolled their way to the Finals again, in which they matched up with a fully healthy
    Cavaliers squad looking for vengance.</p>

  <p> The Warriors went up 3-1 in the series, but due to injuries and suspensions (Draymond Green), the Cavaliers clawed
    their way back to a 3-3 series, heading to game 7 in San Francisco.
    The Warriors led for most of the game, until a clutch 3 from Kyrie Irving put the Cavaliers up 3 with just under a
    minute to go. After that, the Warriors fell short,
    and the Cavaliers completed the first ever 3-1 comeback in NBA finals history.</p>

  <p> Despite the loss, this was a truly historic season for Stephen Curry and the Warriors, and they carried that
    momentum into the next season.</p>

  <h2> 2016-2017 season</h2>

  <h4> <strong> BREAKING NEWS! </strong></h4>

  <p> Yes, you heard that right. Kevin Durant, one of the greatest scorers of all time, signed with the Golden State
    Warriors after their
    historic season. Unfair, right? And the funny thing is, the Warriors beat Durant and the Thunder in the Western
    Conference Finals the year before,
    completing their own 3-1 comeback.</p>

  <p> Anyway, heading into the 2016-2017 season, all eyes were on the Warriors, but most especially Stephen Curry. The
    2016 NBA Finals is his worst Finals
    peformance to date, and he went into the next season with Kevin Durant and dominated everyone, leading the warriors
    to a 67-15 record and being the 1st seed for the 3rd straight year,
    steamrolling through the West and making back to the Finals to face the Cavaliers (again). With Kevin Durant though,
    the Cavs were no math for the
    offensive firepower of the Warriors, and the Warriors beat them in 5 games.</p>

  <h2>2017-2018 season</h2>

  <p> The Warriors continued their reign of terror, but they seemed to have slowed down a little bit, only finishing 2nd
    with a 58-24 record, behind the
    Houston Rockets, led by MVP James Harden. The Warriors and the Rockets faced off in the WCF, but the Warriors barely
    escaped in 7 games, to meet the
    Cavaliers in the Finals. However, Kyrie Irving had left the Cavs the summer before, so the Cavs were really no match
    for the Warriors this time,
    as the Warriors swept them.</p>

  <h2> 2018-2019 season</h2>

  <p> To no once suprise, the Warriors dominated the West (again), finishing with a 57-25 record with the first seed
    again.
    In the Finals, they faced the Toronto Raptors. Unfortunately, in Game 5, Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles in the
    second quarter.
    And in game 6, Klay Thompson tore his ACL. The Warriors didn't have any firepower left, and they went down in 6
    games.</p>

    <h2> 2019-2020 season</h2>

    <p> Curry only played 4 games, as he suffered a wrist injury early into the season, which ended his season, and the Warriors dynasty for a lot.</p>

     <h2> 2020-2021 season</h2>

     <p> Curry returned to full form and led the league in scoring, averaging 32 ppg and leading the Warriors to the 8th seed, but they still had to go through the play-in Tournament.
      They lost the first game to the Lakers, and they lost the second to the Grizzlies, diminishing their playoff chances.</p>

      <h2> 2021-2022 season</h2>

      <p> This season, the Warriors went for their last chance at an NBA championships, with Thompson coming back from injury, and 
        the Warriors signing key players and drafting good young players, like Jonathan Kuminga with the 7th pick, and 
        Moses Moody with the 14th pick in the 2021 draft.</p>

        <p> As the season progressed, and Thompson coming back from injury in late December, the Warriors looked like the prime version,
          finishing as the 3rd seed in the West.
          They beat the Nuggets in 5, the Grizzlies in 6, and the Mavericks in 5 to face the Boston Celtics, led by superstars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.
          The Celtics took a 2-1 lead heading into game 4, that's when Stephen Curry had his greatest Finals performance yet, with 43 points. </p>

        <p><b>After that, the momentum of the series shifted, with the Warriors taking the next 2 games to win the championship in 6 games,
          with Curry winning the Finals MVP.</b></p>
