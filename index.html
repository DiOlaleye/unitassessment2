  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p> Stephen Curry is one of the greatest players to ever touch a basketball. From smooth handles to amazing 3 point
    shooting,
    Steph Curry has cemented himself as a top 10 player of all time. But it wasn't always this way. Today we are going
    back in time
    to the start of his career and we are going to go through each year of his career. Thank you, and enjoy the website.
